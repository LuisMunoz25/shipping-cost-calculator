# 📦 Shipping Cost Calculator (Python)

A simple Python program that calculates shipping costs based on package weight and shipping method.

This project was created as a learning exercise while studying Python on Codecademy.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

The program calculates shipping costs for three different shipping options:

### 1️⃣ Ground Shipping
- Cost is based on the package weight
- Includes a flat fee of **$20**

### 2️⃣ Ground Shipping Premium
- Flat rate shipping
- Cost is always **$125**, regardless of weight

### 3️⃣ Drone Shipping
- Cost is based on the package weight
- No flat fee

The program compares these options and prints the shipping costs.

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/LuisMunoz25/shipping-cost-calculator.git


2. Navigate into the project folder:

  cd shipping-cost-calculator


3. Run the script:

  python shipping-cost-calculator.py

## ⚙️ How to Change the Package Weight

Open the Python file and modify the weight variable:

weight = 41.5


### Change this value to calculate shipping costs for different package weights.

📌 Example Output
The ground shipping fee is: $217.13
Ground Shipping Premium is $125
The drone shipping fee is: $612.13
